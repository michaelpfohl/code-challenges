# Week 3 Code Challenge

## Definitions

- *Variables*: A variable is a placeholder that can hold many different values.
- *Strings*: A string is a data type that is enclosed by quotation marks or back ticks. Typically, a string is formed by words/letters but it can include numbers as well.
- *Functions*: A function is a reusable piece of code that takes in a value known as an argument, changes that argument in some way, and then returns that changed value.
- *if Statements*: An if statement is used to check whether something is true or false (Boolean value) and then direct a function on what step to take according to the result.
- *Boolean values*: A Boolean value is either true or false. Reducing something to a Boolean value is useful for using logic to solve problems.
